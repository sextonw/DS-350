# Set up instuctions

For class, you'll need python 3.7+ and jupyter notebook. If you already have these set up, you should be good to go. If not, I recommend installing the latest [anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/) of python as it includes jupyter notebook as well as many commonly used python packages (e.g., pandas and sklearn).
